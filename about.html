        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          To compound capital responsibly by turning high-quality information into decisive action.
          We aim to be the rare manager that is both deeply fundamental and relentlessly data-native.

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Machine learning models</strong> integrating fundamentals, earnings quality, capital allocation, and competitive dynamics with systematic signals such as post-earnings drift, relative strength, and macro regime shifts.</li>
            <li><strong>Public equities, enhanced with options</strong> for both risk shaping and asymmetric opportunity.</li>
            <li><strong>Disciplined use of leverage in risk-managed trades</strong> to capture market mispricings with defined time horizons.</li>
            <li><strong>Event‑aware frameworks</strong> that explicitly model earnings cycles, macro regime shifts, and fluid market dynamics such as seasonality.</li>

    <h2 class="section-title">Our Edge</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Cross‑Sectional Discipline</h3>
        <p>We apply consistent, comparative analysis across companies, emphasizing durable fundamentals, resilient capital structures, and systematic stress-testing against a broad panel of quantitative indicators.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Psychology Awareness</h3>
        <p>Markets are a mirror of human nature. Our edge is seeing what others look past — the truths within the noise of market data — and acting with clarity.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Leverage & Time Awareness</h3>
        <p>We exploit asymmetry through disciplined use of leverage and a constant awareness of time horizons.
          Every position is framed with explicit risk, defined thesis half-lives, and structured exit criteria—turning time itself into a tradable dimension of edge.</p>

          <li>Relentless focus on the fundamentals and dynamics that truly drive markets.</li>
          <li>Aligned with macroeconomic theses and calibrated to time horizon.</li>
          <li>Respecting the market in the short run, validating conviction in the long run.</li>

        <br>
        <h3>3) Portfolio Construction</h3>

        <h3>Trade Thesis One</h3>
          <h4>Post-Earnings Price Discovery</h4>
          <p>Markets often misprice the <em>time path</em> after earnings. We position for the path, not just the point. And, we allocate risk according to modeled certainty.</p>
      </article>
      <article class="card">
        <h3>Trade Thesis Two</h3>
          <h4>Market Psychology of Fundamentals</h4>
          <p>Markets often behave in strange ways when viewed through an academic lens.
            We position based on valuation at targeted time horizons, while modeling how markets will react across all time horizons.
